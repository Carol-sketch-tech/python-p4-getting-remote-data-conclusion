Getting Remote Data conclusion 
one can build calsses and objects that perform various fucniton in an applicaiton .
however sometimes one might need to incoorporate remote data in our applcation,
we have demondtares that many applcaitons give us access to remote data via applcaitons

APIs give us selective access to the part of a codebase developwes want to expose.
this can make the code base easier to work with.

the follwowing is what i should know 
    1. how APIs work 
    2. how to fnd the endpoit and how to sent requests for data to an 
    API.
with the ability to leverage remote data in our aplications we can increase the functionality of our application and even save time.
