# Getting Remote Data Conclusion

***

## Key Vocab

- **Request**: an attempt by one machine to contact another over the internet.
- **Client**: an application or machine that accesses services being provided by
  a server through the internet.
- **Web Server**: a combination of software and hardware that uses Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols to respond to requests made over
  the internet.

## Conclusion

We've established that you can build classes and object that perform various functions in an application. However, we might want to incorporate remote data into our applications. We've demonstrated that many applications give us access to remote data via APIs.

APIs give us selective access to the parts of a codebase developers want to expose. This can make that codebase easier to work with.

We should now understand how APIs can be used, how to find an API endpoint, and how to send a request for data to an API. With the ability to leverage remote data in our applications, we can increase the functionality of our applications and even save time!
